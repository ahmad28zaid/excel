In order to create this dashboard, I went through the following data analysis process:
1. Cleaned the raw data by removing duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant columns.
2. Processed data set and transformed the datas by creating new columns and applying various functions to extract useful information.
3. Analyzed the data by creating Pivot Tables and Charts to understand the patterns and trends in the sales data.
4. Built the dashboard by incorporating slicers, dynamic charts to provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the data.

The data visualisation gives insight of gender wise sales of the store in
different states of India for variable age of customers.
It also displays order of sales in all months for different category of items. # excel
